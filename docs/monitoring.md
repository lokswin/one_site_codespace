Let’s clarify the roles of **Prometheus**, **Node Exporter**, **Telegraf**, and **Grafana**, and decide whether you can simplify the setup by removing one.

---

### **1. Prometheus**
#### **Role**: Centralized Metrics Collection and Storage
- **Purpose**: Prometheus is the core metrics database. It scrapes data from exporters (like Node Exporter and Telegraf) and stores it in a time-series database.
- **What It Does**:
  - Scrapes metrics from services at regular intervals.
  - Stores these metrics in a time-series database.
  - Provides a query language (`PromQL`) to analyze the data and define alerts.
- **Output**: Stores raw metrics that can be queried directly or visualized in Grafana.

---

### **2. Node Exporter**
#### **Role**: Host Metrics Exporter
- **Purpose**: Exports low-level host system metrics for Prometheus to scrape. Typically monitors physical or virtual machines.
- **What It Does**:
  - Provides metrics about the host system (not containers), such as:
    - **CPU Usage**: Across all cores.
    - **Memory**: Total, free, used, available.
    - **Disk**: Free space, used space, filesystem stats.
    - **Network**: Sent/received packets.
- **When You Need It**:
  - If you're interested in monitoring the overall health of the Docker **host system** running your containers.

---

### **3. Telegraf**
#### **Role**: Metrics Collection Agent
- **Purpose**: Collects container-level metrics, logs, and other data. It's highly flexible and supports many plugins.
- **What It Does**:
  - Can collect metrics directly from Docker containers (e.g., CPU, memory, network, I/O).
  - Supports plugins to pull metrics from a wide range of systems (databases, message queues, cloud providers, etc.).
  - Can send metrics to multiple backends, including Prometheus and Grafana.

- **When You Need It**:
  - If you want detailed **container-level metrics** that Prometheus + Node Exporter can't provide alone.
  - If you want to pull additional application-specific metrics (e.g., from Postgres).

---

### **4. Grafana**
#### **Role**: Visualization and Dashboarding
- **Purpose**: Provides a user-friendly interface to visualize metrics collected by Prometheus and Telegraf.
- **What It Does**:
  - Connects to Prometheus as a data source and visualizes metrics using dashboards.
  - Offers pre-built dashboards for Node Exporter, Docker, and other common tools.
  - Allows you to set up custom dashboards for your specific needs.

---

### **Do You Need All Four?**

- **Can You Remove Node Exporter?**
  - Yes, if you're only interested in **container-level metrics** and not the health of the **host machine**. Telegraf or Docker-specific exporters can cover container metrics.

- **Can You Remove Telegraf?**
  - Yes, if you don't need detailed application metrics or container-level stats and are satisfied with Prometheus + Node Exporter for host-level metrics.

- **Can You Remove Prometheus?**
  - No, Prometheus is the heart of the monitoring system. Without it, metrics collection and querying wouldn't be possible.

- **Can You Remove Grafana?**
  - Yes, if you don’t need visualization or are okay with using Prometheus’s built-in query interface (though it's less user-friendly).

---

### **Recommended Minimal Setup:**

1. **Prometheus + Grafana + Node Exporter**:
   - Use this setup if you're interested in monitoring the host machine and don't need detailed container or application metrics.

2. **Prometheus + Grafana + Telegraf**:
   - Use this if you want **container-level metrics** and don't need to monitor the host system explicitly.
