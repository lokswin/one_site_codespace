08/09/2024 19:00:07 Client Side Caching: -ncache mode is in effect to provide
08/09/2024 19:00:07   client-side pixel data caching.  This speeds up
08/09/2024 19:00:07   iconifying/deiconifying windows, moving and raising
08/09/2024 19:00:07   windows, and reposting menus.  In the simple CopyRect
08/09/2024 19:00:07   encoding scheme used (no compression) a huge amount
08/09/2024 19:00:07   of extra memory (20-100MB) is used on both the server and
08/09/2024 19:00:07   client sides.  This mode works with any VNC viewer.
08/09/2024 19:00:07   However, in most you can actually see the cached pixel
08/09/2024 19:00:07   data by scrolling down, so you need to re-adjust its size.
08/09/2024 19:00:07   See http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/faq.html#faq-client-caching.
08/09/2024 19:00:07   If this mode yields undesired behavior (poor response,
08/09/2024 19:00:07   painting errors, etc) it may be disabled via: '-ncache 0'
08/09/2024 19:00:07   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to 
08/09/2024 19:00:07   repaint the screen, also see the -fixscreen option for
08/09/2024 19:00:07   periodic repaints.
08/09/2024 19:00:07 
08/09/2024 19:00:07 XKEYBOARD: number of keysyms per keycode 7 is greater
08/09/2024 19:00:07   than 4 and 51 keysyms are mapped above 4.
08/09/2024 19:00:07   Automatically switching to -xkb mode.
08/09/2024 19:00:07   If this makes the key mapping worse you can
08/09/2024 19:00:07   disable it with the "-noxkb" option.
08/09/2024 19:00:07   Also, remember "-remap DEAD" for accenting characters.
