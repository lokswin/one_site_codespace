02/09/2024 21:44:23 Wireframing: -wireframe mode is in effect for window moves.
02/09/2024 21:44:23   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
02/09/2024 21:44:23   errors, etc) it may be disabled:
02/09/2024 21:44:23    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
02/09/2024 21:44:23    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
02/09/2024 21:44:23      moved window is released in the new position.
02/09/2024 21:44:23   Also see the -help entry for tuning parameters.
02/09/2024 21:44:23   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to 
02/09/2024 21:44:23   repaint the screen, also see the -fixscreen option for
02/09/2024 21:44:23   periodic repaints.

02/09/2024 21:44:23 XFIXES available on display, resetting cursor mode
02/09/2024 21:44:23   to: '-cursor most'.
02/09/2024 21:44:23   to disable this behavior use: '-cursor arrow'
02/09/2024 21:44:23   or '-noxfixes'.

02/09/2024 21:44:23 Scroll Detection: -scrollcopyrect mode is in effect to
02/09/2024 21:44:23   use RECORD extension to try to detect scrolling windows
02/09/2024 21:44:23   (induced by either user keystroke or mouse input).
02/09/2024 21:44:23   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
02/09/2024 21:44:23   errors, etc) it may be disabled via: '-noscr'
02/09/2024 21:44:23   Also see the -help entry for tuning parameters.
02/09/2024 21:44:23   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to

02/09/2024 21:44:23   Automatically switching to -xkb mode.
02/09/2024 21:44:23   If this makes the key mapping worse you can
02/09/2024 21:44:23   disable it with the "-noxkb" option.

******************************************************************************
Have you tried the x11vnc '-ncache' VNC client-side pixel caching feature yet?

The scheme stores pixel data offscreen on the VNC viewer side for faster
retrieval.  It should work with any VNC viewer.  Try it by running:

    x11vnc -ncache 10 ...

One can also add -ncache_cr for smooth 'copyrect' window motion.
