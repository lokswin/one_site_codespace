# website Browser Container

This repository provides a containerized environment for accessing website (free version) using GitHub Codespaces. The setup is optimized to be lightweight, secure, and easy to use.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: Utilizes `qutebrowser`, a minimal web browser, for accessing website.
- **Secure**: Runs as a non-root user with restricted network access and a read-only filesystem.
- **Open-Source**: Relies exclusively on free and open-source tools.
- **Simplified**: Streamlined setup with minimal complexity and dependencies.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**:
   Fork this repository to your GitHub account and clone it to your local machine.

2. **Open in GitHub Codespaces**:
   Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces to start the environment automatically.

3. **Run the Container**:
   The environment will start and launch `qutebrowser` in fullscreen mode, pointing to website.

## Configuration

- **Dockerfile**: Defines the container image and its dependencies.
- **`entrypoint.sh`**: Launches the necessary services and `qutebrowser`.
- **`cleanup.sh`**: Cleans up temporary files and reduces image size after setup.

## Security

- **Non-Root Execution**: The container runs as a non-root user to enhance security.
- **Network Restrictions**: The container is restricted to accessing only the website website.
- **Read-Only Filesystem**: The filesystem is mounted as read-only to prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Testing and Validation

- **Functional Testing**: Ensure that the setup works correctly in GitHub Codespaces.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the container’s performance to ensure it remains efficient.

## Cleanup

A `cleanup.sh` script is included to remove unnecessary files and reduce the overall image size. This script will be executed automatically as part of the container’s entrypoint.
